      "text": "Tamed with 13 beef and found in plains biomes. They can be mounted and ridden at high speed, but they will also fight alongside you and give you a strength buff when they attack a mob. When tamed they receive a boost in health and speed. They are bred with glyptodon meat! Made to sit or stand by shift clicking. They can be healed with beef."
